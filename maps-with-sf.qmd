## Overview

-   Spatial data in R
-   Simple features, the `sf` R package
-   Geometrical operations
-   Tidy: `sf`, `dplyr` & `ggplot2`

## What makes spatial data challenging?

> -   The Earth is a sphere/spheroid/potato\*
> -   coordinates consist of two or three numbers that *lose most of their meaning when considered individually*
> -   the most common form is Longitude, Latitude (LL) pairs
> -   from LL data, `stats::dist` will not give you distances
> -   maps and screens are flat, and hence can only show *projected* data
> -   projected distances are distorted, and possibly areas, shapes, directions and shortest paths too

## What makes spatial data challenging?

> -   the meaning of a LL coordinate depends on the geographic *datum* (e.g., WGS84, ETRS89, NAD27 etc)
> -   a *datum* is unlikely important when mapping continents, but it is when drones try to deliver pizzas

## Simple features

-   **feature**: abstraction of real world phenomena (type or instance); has a geometry and other attributes (properties)
-   **simple feature**: feature with all geometric attributes described piecewise by straight line or planar interpolation between sets of points (no curves) <img src="sf.png" width="200"/>
-   represent geometry by *points*, *lines* or *polygons*, or *collections* thereof

## Simple features

-   a formal standard (ISO, OGC) since 2004
-   supported by OSGeo libraries GEOS and GDAL
-   adopted by GeoJSON, GeoSPARQL
-   has well-known text (WKT) and binary (WKB) encodings
-   WKB used by spatial databases (PostGIS, MariaDB, SQLite, ...)
-   standard specifies a number of topological metrics, predicates and operations

## Operations on geometries:

Single:

-   logical predicates: `is_valid`, `is_simple`, `is_empty`
-   quantities: `length`, `area`
-   `dimension`: 0 = point(s), 1 = linear, 2 = surface
-   derived geometries: `buffer`, `centroid`, `boundary`, `convex_hull`, `simplify`, `linemerge`, `polygonize`, `node`, `point_on_surface`, `triangulate`

## Operations on geometries:

Pairs/sets:

-   quantities: `distance`
-   predicates: `intersects`, `within`, `contains`, `covers`, `covered_by`, `crosses`, `touches`, `overlaps`, `equals`, `disjoint`, all other DE-9IM
-   new geometries: `intersection`, `difference`, `union`, `sym_difference`

## Intersection special cases

![](images/empty.png){width="720"}

-   (typed) `EMPTY`: think of as missing (`NA`) geometry
-   `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`: *single* feature geometry with mix of anything

## Package `sf`

> -   `sf` stores simple feature geometries **as a list-column**

> -   It does that in `sf` objects, *extending* `data.frame` **or** `tibble`

> -   How does it work?

## Package `sf` features

-   `sf` objects extend `data.frame` or `tbl_df` with a geometry list-column
-   fast (C++) WKB $\Longleftrightarrow$ R conversion, used for I/O with libraries and databases
-   spatial indexes created on-the-fly to scale up geometrical predicates (intersects) and operations (intersection), and selections (nearest feature)

## Package `sf` features

-   simple and relatively small API
-   functions/methods start with `st_`, as in

```{r example,echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
st_is_simple(st_point(0:1))
```

## `sf` & `tidyverse`

-   `sf` spatial objects are `data.frame`s (or `tibble`s)
-   you can always un-`sf`, and work with `tbl_df` or `data.frame` having an `sfc` list-column
-   `sf` methods for `filter`, `arrange`, `distinct`, `group_by`, `ungroup`, `mutate`, `select` have sticky geometry

## `sf` & `tidyverse`

-   `st_join` joins tables based on a spatial predicate, or user-defined function
-   `summarise` unions geometry by group (or altogether) ![](images/summ.png){width="800"}

## Conclusions

-   `sf` provides tidy spatial analysis, for vector data
-   there are 6 package vignettes for further reading
